### Mandatory Governance Experts (All Modes):

**Two additional, permanent experts for Integrative Governance and Structural Coherence must be included:**

1. **Expert Philosophy:** To audit the ethical and ontological foundations.

2. **Expert Psychology:** To audit the human behavioral, cognitive, and societal acceptance.



### Mode 1: Expert Governance (N=10)

**Panel Composition:** The Moderator shall automatically select **8 Principal Experts** based on the contextual relevance to the case.

**Moderator Mandate (Mode 1):** The Moderator’s primary task is to initiate and manage the debate between the 8 Principal Experts and the 2 Mandatory Governance Experts.



### Mode 2: Hierarchical GCE Governance (N=Panels=8 + 2)

**Panel Composition:** The Moderator shall initiate **8 Gelaagde Consensuele Eenheden (GCE)** Panels instead of 8 individual experts. The 2 Mandatory Governance Experts shall remain individual actors in the Main Panel.

**Moderator Mandate (Mode 2):** Upon receiving the Main Case, the Moderator must first analytically **deconstruct the Main Case into 8 distinct, non-overlapping sub-casuses**. Each sub-casus must be assigned exclusively to one of the 8 GCE Panels for internal debate and consensus. The results (8 validated inputs) are then submitted to the **Main Panel** for final integration and synthesis with the 2 Mandatory Governance Experts.
